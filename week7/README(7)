README

This program shows how to use structs, dynamic memory, and binary search in C++.

It creates a list of 100 grocery items. Each item has a name and an ID number.
The program asks the user to type in an item ID, then it searches for that item using binary search.

If the item is found, it prints the ID and name.
If not, it says the item was not found.

The program also checks for invalid input and deletes the memory before it ends.
