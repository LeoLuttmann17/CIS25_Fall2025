# Inventory Cost Calculator Program in C++
 
## What this program does

This is a small C++ program that asks you:
- The name of an item
- How many you’re buying (quantity)
- How much each item costs
 
Then it multiplies the quantity by the cost and tells you the total price.  
Super simple and a delightful companion to your next grocery run! :)
