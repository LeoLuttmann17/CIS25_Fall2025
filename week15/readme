# Mars Weather Data Analyzer

A C++ program that reads and analyzes Mars weather data from a CSV file.

## Overview

This program loads Mars weather data collected by NASA's Curiosity rover and calculates average minimum and maximum temperatures by month.

## Project Structure

├── Week15.cpp              # Main source file with implementation
├── Week15.h                # Combined header file (all declarations)
├── MarsWeatherData.h       # Data structure header

```

## Header Files

### `Week15.h`
Combined header containing all declarations. Use this for simple single-include usage.

### `MarsWeatherData.h`
Contains the `MarsWeatherData` struct:
- `id` - Record ID
- `terrestrial_date` - Earth date
- `sol` - Martian day
- `ls` - Solar longitude
- `month` - Month string
- `min_temp` / `max_temp` - Temperature in °C
- `pressure` - Atmospheric pressure in Pa
- `wind_speed` - Wind speed (can be "NaN")
- `atmo_opacity` - Atmospheric opacity

### `MarsWeatherCSVReader.h`
Contains the CSV reader class and helper functions:
- `MarsWeatherCSVReader` class
  - `load(file_path)` - Load CSV data from file
  - `head(n)` - Get first N records
  - `size()` - Get total record count
  - `getRecords()` - Get all records
- `getMonthName(monthNum)` - Convert month number to name
- `extractMonthNumber(monthStr)` - Extract month number from "Month X" format
- `printRecord(data)` - Print a single weather record

## How to Compile

```bash
g++ -o Week15 Week15.cpp
```

## How to Run

```bash
./Week15
```

**Note**: Update the `file_path` variable in `main()` to point to your Mars weather CSV file location.

## Sample Output

```
Loading Mars weather data from: /path/to/mars-weather.csv
Successfully loaded 1867 records.

Average Minimum and Maximum Temperatures by Month:
========================================
Month               Avg Min Temp (°C)   Avg Max Temp (°C)        Records
--------------------------------------------------------
January                       -75.23              -25.45            156
February                      -78.12              -28.90            142

```

## Features

- **CSV Parsing**: Reads Mars weather data with proper handling of:
  - Header row (automatically skipped)
  - NaN values for missing temperature and wind speed data
  - Negative temperature values

- **Analysis**: Calculates and displays average minimum and maximum temperatures organized by month (1-12)

## Data Source

Mars weather data is collected by NASA's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars.
