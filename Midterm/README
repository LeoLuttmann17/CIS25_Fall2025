# Bank Account Simulation (C++)

Welcome to **Leo's Bank Account Simulation!**  
This C++ program lets you manage a simple digital bank account — deposit money, make purchases, check your balance, and view your transaction history.  

All transactions are automatically saved to a file so you can keep track of your account activity.

## How It Works

- You start with a **$1000.00** balance.
