Leo's Inventory Program

Description:
This is a simple C++ console program that helps you manage a small inventory.
It greets the user once at the start, shows a menu of options, and allows you to view, add, or search for items.
It uses a class called Item to store the name and quantity of each item.

****************************************************************************************************

Features
- Prints a friendly welcome message once at the beginning.
- Shows a clear menu with options to:
- View existing inventory
- Enter new item names and quantities
- Search for an item by name
- xit the program

Prevents invalid inputs:
- Rejects empty or special-character names.
- Accepts only positive numbers for quantities.
- If you enter something invalid, it politely asks you to try again.

If an item cannot be found, it says:
- “Oops, I can’t find this. Please try again or type QUIT to exit.”

After every completed action, it asks: “What do you want to do next?” and shows the menu again.

HOW IT WORKS

- It preloads 5 sample coffee items (like Espresso, Latte, Mocha, etc.).

- The user picks an action from the menu:
    Option 1: Shows the list of all items and their quantities.
    Option 2: Lets you re-enter 5 new items and their quantities.
    Option 3: Lets you search for an item by typing its name.
    Option 0: Ends the program.
