Student Project – Scope of Work (SOW)

Project Title: Kinetic Sculpture “Out of Reach” 
Student Name: Julius Leonard Luttmann 
Date: Sep 5, 2025

1. Project Overview
This project is a portfolio piece for my transfer application. “Out of Reach” is an interactive kinetic sculpture symbolizing the sun from the human perspective. It consists of a motorized magnetic spinner underneath a 3D sun’s surface, which makes the metal surface “Fur” move in an organic fashion similar to actual solar flares. There will be hand-soldered LED nodes covering the surface as well. Attached to the podium of the sculpture will be a Sonar-sensor and Arduino. As the viewer increasingly approaches the sculpture, the LEDs nodes will turn from a warm orange-yellow tone to a bright light, mimicking the fact that the factually white light of the sun appears warmer in shade due to the Earth’s atmosphere.  

2. Goals
The sonar sensor measures the closest distance of a nearby object, i.e. viewer. 
With increasing proximity of the viewer to the sculpture, turn the light nodes from a warm orange-yellow to bright white light.

3. Deliverables
Program files (main.cpp + others)
Printables file for the magnetic spinner built 
Output.pdf with screenshots and explanation
GitHub submission with correct file structure
Video demonstration of the working kinetic sculpture

4. Timeline
Week 1–2: Define idea & set up GitHub
Week 3–4: Build program features
Week 5: Test & debug
Week 6: Write Output.pdf
Week 7: Submit final project

5. Success Criteria
The project runs correctly, includes required features, and all files are submitted on time.
